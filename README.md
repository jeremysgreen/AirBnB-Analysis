Code and visuals for a project about AirBnB prices in different major cities across the US. Example 1 shows a layout of Denver, CO by neighborhood with red indiciating higher average listing price, and yellow indicating lower. Example 2 shows the number of listings per neighborhood. Example 3 shows the location of the listings in New Orleans in comparison to the price of listings by neighborhood for reference. I was able to create the Tableau visuals by downloading publicly available AirBnB data and GeoJSON files of each city, and joining them together on Tableau desktop.
